title: Security
---
## Description

The Security section is dedicated to ensuring the safety of applications and infrastructure at all stages of development and operation. This component of the platform helps identify vulnerabilities, control access to data and resources, and comply with security standards. Key tasks include threat protection, security monitoring, automated checks, and adherence to best DevSecOps practices.

The goal of this section is to create a secure environment for development and deployment, ensuring data control and protection for clients.

 ### Key Components

**1. Vulnerability Management**  
•	**Description:** Scanning and managing vulnerabilities in applications and infrastructure.  
•	**Tools:** SonarQube, AWS Inspector, Vanta, Trivy etc.  
•	**Practices:** Regular scans to detect vulnerabilities in source code and containers. Prioritizing the remediation of critical vulnerabilities.  

**2. Access Control and Identity Management**  
•	**Description:** Manage access to applications and infrastructure, as well as control user identification and authentication.  
•	**Tools:** AWS IAM, Google Cloud IAM, Okta, Auth0 etc.  
•	**Practices:** Setting up roles and access rights based on the Principle of Least Privilege to protect data and resources.  

**3. Security Monitoring and Logging**  
•	**Description:** Monitoring security events and logging to detect suspicious activities and analyze incidents.  
•	**Tools:** Splunk, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Datadog, AWS CloudTrail, Arctic Wolf, Lacework etc.  
•	**Practices:** Continuous monitoring of applications and user activities, event logging to identify threats. Configuring alerts for immediate response to suspicious actions.  

**4. Compliance Management**  
•	**Description:** Managing compliance with security and data privacy standards such as SOC 2, PCI-DSS, etc.  
•	**Tools:** AWS Artifact, Google Cloud Compliance Reports, policy-based automation.  
•	**Practices:** Regular compliance checks and automated reporting for quick tracking and adherence to standards.  

**5. Automated Security Testing**  
•	**Description:** Automated security testing during development and deployment stages to detect issues before code goes into production.  
•	**Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Checkmarx.  
•	**Practices:** Integrating vulnerability tests into the CI/CD pipeline, regular checks of code components and infrastructure for security issues.  

### Key Approaches

**1. DevSecOps**  
Integrating security practices at every stage of development and operation. DevSecOps allows for the implementation of security checks and automated testing directly into CI/CD workflows.

**2. Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**  
Access to resources is limited to the minimum necessary rights. This approach reduces risks by minimizing the likelihood of data leakage or system compromise.

**3. Continuous Security Monitoring**
Continuous monitoring of security events and logs allows for rapid incident response. This helps identify anomalies and eliminate threats at early stages.

**4. Compliance as Code**  
Automating compliance checks with security and privacy requirements (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2) through code. Compliance as Code allows standardization and control over compliance.

**5. Policy as Code**  
Describing security policies in code allows the application of proven software development methods, such as version control, automated testing, and automated deployment.

**6. Secure Code Review**  
Regular code reviews to detect vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security standards. Automated scanners and manual reviews help prevent the release of insecure code.

### Recommendations and Best Practices
•	Integrate security into the CI/CD pipeline: Automate security checks at every stage of development.  
•	Use the principle of least privilege: Configure resource access based on user needs.  
•	Set up security monitoring and alerts: Regular log monitoring and immediate notifications help detect threats in time.  
•	Regularly check compliance with standards: Adhere to security and data privacy requirements.  
•	Conduct code reviews for security: Periodic code checks help minimize risks.  
•	Prevent secret sprawl: Avoid using plaintext secrets in code or pipelines.  
•	Prevent privileged access abuse: Implement session recording and auditing.
