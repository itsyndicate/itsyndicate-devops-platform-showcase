title: Hosting
---
## Description
The Hosting section of the platform covers the management of the infrastructure on which applications and services run. Our main task is to ensure the stability, scalability, security, and availability of hosting, as well as the efficient use of resources. This section helps engineers plan and maintain the infrastructure, taking into account project requirements and client needs.

The goal of this section and our efforts is to build a flexible and reliable environment for hosting applications that can easily scale and adapt to changes in load and requirements.

### Key Approaches

**1. Well-Architected Framework**  
The AWS Well-Architected Framework is developed by Amazon Web Services for creating cloud architectures that are reliable, secure, high-performing, and cost-effective. The framework provides a set of recommendations and best practices for building and optimizing architecture in the AWS cloud, based on five key principles.

**7. Kubernetes and Microservices**
Kubernetes (K8s) and microservices are approaches to building scalable and flexible applications.  
	Microservices: An architectural style where an application is divided into small, autonomous components (services) that perform specific functions and can be deployed, updated, and scaled independently. Microservices help teams develop and deploy parts of an application faster and more flexibly.  
	Kubernetes (K8s): An open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes is especially useful for microservice architecture, as it allows easy management of multiple services, ensuring their availability and resilience. With Kubernetes, teams can flexibly manage workloads, automate scaling and balancing, and ensure high availability of each microservice.  

Combining K8s and microservices provides high flexibility and resilience, making it ideal for creating modern cloud and distributed applications.

### Recommendations and Best Practices

•	Use IaC for deploying and managing infrastructure: This simplifies creating, modifying, and deleting resources.  
•	Configure automatic resource scaling: This will maintain performance under variable loads.  
•	Implement backups and recovery plans: Regularly test backup integrity and recovery speed.  
•	Deploy applications in multiple availability zones: This increases system resilience to failures.  
•	Separate environments into different accounts: Projects and environments should be divided into different accounts of the cloud provider used; these accounts can be centrally managed from a master account.  
•	Plan before implementation: Always plan your infrastructure and deployments ahead.  
•	Develop and test in environments similar to production: The test environment should closely match production.  
•	Optimize hosting costs: Use cost analysis, disable unused resources, and apply appropriate instance types to reduce expenses.
