# Monitoring
---
## Description

The Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting section provides visibility into the state of applications and infrastructure, collects logs, and sets up alerts for timely detection and resolution of issues. This platform component helps maintain high availability, respond quickly to failures, and reduce the impact of incidents on the business.

This section aims to provide transparency in system operations, detect problems at early stages, and react swiftly to minimize downtime and ensure stable operation.

### Key Components

**1. Application Monitoring**  
•	**Description:** Observing the state and performance of applications to ensure stable operation and identify bottlenecks.  
•	**Tools:** Prometheus + Grafana, New Relic, Datadog, Elastic Observability.  
•	**Practices:** Setting up performance metrics such as response time, CPU load, memory usage, and database state. Tracking application errors and third-party services.  

**2. Infrastructure Monitoring**  
•	**Description:** Observing the state of infrastructure (servers, containers, networks) to prevent failures and optimize resources.  
•	**Tools:** Prometheus + Grafana, Zabbix, AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring, Datadog, Elastic Observability.  
•	**Practices:** Regular monitoring of resource states (CPU, memory, network connections) and automatic notifications when deviations from the norm occur.  

**3. Logging**  
•	**Description:** Collecting, storing, and analyzing logs to track system activities and diagnose incidents.  
•	**Tools:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, Graylog, Fluentd.  
•	**Practices:** Centralized collection of logs from all system components, including applications, servers, and containers. Searching and filtering key events to identify incident causes.  

**4. Alerting**  
•	**Description:** Setting up notifications to inform the team about critical events and system performance deviations.  
•	**Tools:** PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Slack, Telegram, AWS SNS.  
•	**Practices:** Configuring alerts based on priority (informational, warnings, critical) with different escalation levels. Ensuring timely team response to incidents.  

**5. Distributed Tracing**  
•	**Description:** Tracking requests between different microservices to identify delays and performance issues.  
•	**Tools:** Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray.  
•	**Practices:** A complete overview of the request path through microservices, helping to detect bottlenecks and improve performance.  

### Key Approaches

**1. SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)**  
SRE is an approach to managing the reliability and performance of systems, combining development and operational management methods. The main principle of SRE is to automate and optimize routine processes to enhance resilience and efficiency. SRE engineers use code and automation to perform tasks traditionally done manually (e.g., scaling, monitoring, incident management).

**2. Observability**  
Observability is a key approach that combines monitoring, logging, and tracing to understand the system’s state fully. It allows not only tracking metrics and logs but also deeper analysis of system behavior.

**3. Alerting Based on Severity**  
Setting up notifications considering the severity level of events. Applying an approach where not all events require immediate reaction helps reduce team workload and respond only to critical incidents.

**4. Centralized Logging**  
Centralized collection of logs from various sources helps simplify analysis and speed up problem resolution. This approach includes setting up filters and rules for quick search of key events.

**5. Proactive Monitoring**  
Monitoring and alerts should be set up not only to react to problems but also to prevent potential incidents. This allows detect trends and prevent overloads or failures before they become critical.

**6. Root Cause Analysis**  
Procedures for analyzing the root cause of an incident after its resolution to prevent the recurrence of issues. Includes detailed analysis of logs, metrics, and tracing.

### Recommendations and Best Practices  

•	Aim for full observability: Combine monitoring, logging, and tracing to have a complete understanding of the system’s state.  
•	Set up priority-based alerts: Differentiate alert levels so the team responds to the most critical incidents.  
•	Maintain centralized logs: Collected logs should be accessible and structured for easy search and analysis.  
•	Implement proactive monitoring: Capture trends to prevent issues before they occur.
•	Use root cause analysis: To prevent repeat incidents and achieve long-term system optimization.  
•	Build monitoring with the Drill-Down principle: From general to specific. The monitoring hierarchy should allow quick transitions from the main dashboard to details— from the environment to resources, then to specific resource metrics. This simplifies problem localization and detailed system analysis.  
•	Monitor business processes: Your monitoring should not only be based on server metrics but also be useful for the business. Understand which processes are important for successful business operations and monitor these processes.  
•	Choose strategy and metrics wisely: Select the appropriate monitoring strategy and necessary metrics.  
•	Identify third-party integration errors: Often, application operation may depend on third-party resources that can fail; this must also be considered.
