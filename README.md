# ITSyndicate Developer Platform

Welcome to the ITSyndicate Developer Platform! This guide will help you get started with Backstage, the internal developer portal we're using to centralize services and make it easier for our developers to collaborate and innovate.

**The easiest way to try our showcase is to follow the link:** https://demoplatform.itsyndicate.org/

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1.22.5 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional, for containerized services)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the ITSyndicate Developer Platform repository from GitLab:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/itsyndicate/itsyndicate-devops-platform-showcase.git
$ cd demo
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Use Yarn to install the required dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env`:

```sh
$ mv .env.sample .env
```

Update the environment variables in the `.env` file as needed. Then export them:

```sh
$ export $(cat .env | xargs)
```


### Step 4: Start the Development Server

To start the Backstage development server, run the following command:

```sh
$ yarn dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Building the Application

To build the application for production, use:

```sh
$ yarn build
```

This command will generate static assets in the `packages/app/dist` directory.

## Running with Docker



### Step 1: Build backstage

Use Yarn to buildÂ backstage with the appropriate configuration:

```sh
$ yarn build:backend --config ../../app-config.yaml --config ../../app-config.production.yaml
```

### Step 2: Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for backstage, run:

```sh
$ docker image build . -f packages/backend/Dockerfile --tag backstage
```

### Step 3: Run the Docker Container with PostgreSQL

Run the application in a Docker container:

```sh
$ docker run -it -p 7007:7007 --env-file .env backstage
```

Docker is always configured for production use, and requires PostgreSQL as the database. Ensure your `.env.production` file contains the correct PostgreSQL connection settings.
